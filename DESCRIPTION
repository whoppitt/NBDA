Description: Implements network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA). Currently limited to order of acquisition diffusion analysis (OADA), time of acquisition diffusion analysis (TADA) to follow. Models are fitted by maximum likeihood and confidence intervals can be calculated using profile likelihood techniques. Multi-model inference methods using AIC/AICc can also be performed. Random effects can be fitted using the functions provided in the coxme package. Multiple networks can be included, each representing a difference diffusion pathway.
